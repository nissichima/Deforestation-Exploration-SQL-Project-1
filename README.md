Prepare a report for the executive team to understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.
Identifying the most concerning regions and countries experiencing severe drop in forest area to determine where to concentrate efforts to combat deforestation.

Techniques used: Create View, Table; Boolean Operators; Aggregations, Window Functions, Joins, CASE Statements

Part 2 - Management of Relational & Non-Relational Databases
Databases need to be structured properly to enable efficient and effective querying and analysis of data.
Build normalized, consistent and performant relational data models.
Use SQL Database Definition Language (DDL) to create the data schemas designed in Postgres and apply SQL Database Manipulation Language (DML) to migrate data from a denormalized schema to a normalized one.
Understand the tradeoffs between relational databases and their non-relational counterparts and justify which one is best for different scenarios.
With a radical shift of paradigms, learn about MongoDB and Redis to get an understanding of the differences in behaviors and requirements for non-relational databases.
